Hello! I am a `PhD Candidate` at the `Northwestern University's` Transportation Systems Analysis and Planning Program in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. I am currently working at the `Transportation Center` as a graduate research assistant under the supervision of `Prof. Hani Mahmassani`. My research braodly focuses on understanding human-technology-infrastructure-market interactions through a lens of socio-technical systems analysis framework to enable next generation transportation systems that are sustainable, safe, smart, resilient, and equitable. 

My dissertation research addresses the question of the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic altered the telemobility landscape in the United States; and
the implications of these potentially changing trends on mobility and sustainability of our cities, which generally have several subsystems optimized around the idea of weekday commute hour or presence of many individuals at the same place and at the same time. To address this question, I posit cities as a complex socio-technical system with multiple interacting actors that either depend on or compete with each other (e.g.,consumers, employers, businesses, public agencies etc.). I argue that the advent of information and communications technologies (ICTs) opened a new pathway of complex interaction between various actors and the pandemic induced shocks forced the involved actors to adapt. To understand the changing trends in telemobility adoption patterns because of the COVID-19 pandemic, my research focuses on
looking at these changing trends from both the demand and supply side perspective since the decisions made at one end of this socio-technical system will define the patterns of adoption at other end and will eventually determine the resulting changes in the telemobility landscape. 

Other areas of research that I have explored in the past include understnading travel behavior and its interaction with social networks, advanced behavioral modeling, big data analysis and freight planning, machine learning applications in transportation, particularly unsupervised learning and ensemble learning models.
