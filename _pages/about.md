Hello! I am postdoctoral researcher at the Northwestern University Transportation Center. I recently completed my PhD from the Northwestern University's Transportation Systems Analysis and Planning Program in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. My disseration titled `Telemobility Through the Pandemic: Longitudinal Tracking, Modeling and Outlook` can be found [`here`](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2856237653/8DE64DED95504441PQ){:target="_blank"}

My dissertation research addresses the question of the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic altered the `telemobility` landscape in the United States; and the implications of these potentially changing trends on mobility and sustainability of our cities. Other areas of research that I have explored in the past include understanding `travel behavior` and its interaction with `social networks`, advanced behavioral modeling, big `GPS data` analysis and freight planning, `machine learning` applications in `transportation`, particularly unsupervised learning and ensemble learning models.
