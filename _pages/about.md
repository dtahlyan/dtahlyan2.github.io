I am a `PhD Candidate` at the `Northwestern University's` Transportation Systems Analysis and Planning Program in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. I am currently working at the `Transportation Center` as a graduate research assistant under the supervision of `Prof. Hani Mahmassani`. My research focuses on enabling safe, smart, sustainable, resilient and equitable transportation systems.

### Research Interests

* `Statistical, econometric and machine learning methods for transportation data analysis`: discrete choice and ordered response models, integrated choice and latent variable models, count data models, heterogeneity and hierarchical models, structural equation modeling, latent class and latent transition analysis, machine learning based classifiers (SVM, neural networks, decision trees), ensemble learning, and causal inference.

* `ICT and travel`: role of perceptions, attitudes, experiences, constraints and satisfaction on tele-activities adoption and future retention, virtual/physical activity interaction, tele-activity and well-being.

* `Social networks and travel`: Egocentric network data collection and synthetic social network generation, social capital measurement, dimensions and impact on activity participation.

* `Transportation sector electrification`: Resilience and evacuation planning, transportation interaction with energy. 

* `Sustainability and equity`: Micro- and shared mobility, well-being, reducing car dependence, accessibility. 

* `Route choice modeling`: choice set generation algorithms, truck route choice, use of large scale passive data sources

* `Crash data analysis`: frequency and severity modeling and prediction, zero-inflated and limited dependent variable models, unobserved heterogeneity and hierarchical models, spatial transfer-ability and temporal instability.
